# HoloJS

HoloJS is a framework for creating UWP applications using JavaScript and WebGL. 

HoloJS is a C++ library that hosts [ChakraCore](https://github.com/microsoft/chakracore) to run JavaScript code, and also hosts ANGLE to
handle OpenGL ES graphics calls. OpenGL ES calls are translated from WebGL calls by the
JavaScript app. When running on a Microsoft HoloLens, HoloJS supports holographic rendering.

## Code sample

A sample project is included for Windows Holographic. The sample takes a few moments to load 
and there is no loading indicator.

The sample works on Windows Holographic by getting a holographic view matrix from the HoloJS
host layer. This is done in JavaScript by calling window.getViewMatrix():

```js
// Draw the cube.
gl.bindBuffer(gl.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, cubeVerticesIndexBuffer);
gl.uniformMatrix4fv(pUniform, false, new Float32Array(identity));
gl.uniformMatrix4fv(mUniform, false, new Float32Array(model));
gl.uniformMatrix4fv(vUniform, false, window.getViewMatrix());
gl.drawElements(gl.TRIANGLES, 36, gl.UNSIGNED_SHORT, 0);
```

This view matrix represents a view from the middle point between left and right views of the 
holographic stereo camera. The app should not set a projection matrix in this case, or it should 
set a projection matrix that is the identity matrix. ANGLE for Windows Holographic will apply 
the correct projection matrices for the holographic device to each vertex automatically, after 
splitting the output into left and right views by using a geometry shader.


## Additional remarks

**Note** This library requires Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 to build, and supports Windows Universal 
platforms such as Windows 10 and Windows Holographic. Windows Holographic devices include the 
Microsoft HoloLens and the Microsoft HoloLens Emulator.
 
To obtain information about Windows 10 development, go to the [Windows Dev Center]
(http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532421).

To obtain information about the tools used for Windows Holographic development, including Microsoft 
Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 and the Microsoft HoloLens Emulator, go to [Install the tools]
(https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/holographic/install_the_tools).

## Reference

The following Windows Universal APIs are used to demonstrate spatial locations, and holographic 
rendering in this code sample:

* [ChakraCore official site](https://github.com/microsoft/ChakraCore)
* [Chakra samples repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/Chakra-Samples)
* [ANGLE Experimental for Windows Holographic](https://github.com/Microsoft/angle/tree/ms-holographic-experimental)

## System requirements

**Client:** Windows 10, Windows 10 Holographic

**Phone:** Not tested

## Build the sample

1. Clone the repo, then update submodules so that you get ANGLE.
2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you cloned the repo, go to the HoloJS subfolder. Double-click 
   the Visual Studio 2015 Solution (.sln) file.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.

## Run the sample

The next steps depend on whether you just want to deploy the sample or you want to both deploy and 
run it.

### Deploying the sample to the Microsoft HoloLens emulator

- Click the debug target drop-down, and select **Microsoft HoloLens Emulator**.
- Select **Build** \> **Deploy** Solution.

### Deploying the sample to a Microsoft HoloLens

- Developer unlock your Microsoft HoloLens. For instructions, go to [Enable your device for development](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development#enable-your-windows-10-devices).
- Find the IP address of your Microsoft HoloLens. The IP address can be found in **Settings** \> 
  **Network & Internet** \> **Wi-Fi** \> **Advanced options**. Or, you can ask Cortana for this 
  information by saying: "Hey Cortana, what's my IP address?"
- Right-click on your project in Visual Studio, and then select **Properties**.
- In the Debugging pane, click the drop-down and select **Remote Machine**.
- Enter the IP address of your Microsoft HoloLens into the field labelled **Machine Name**.
- Click **OK**.
- Select **Build** \> **Deploy** Solution.

### Pairing your developer-unlocked Microsoft HoloLens with Visual Studio

The first time you deploy from your development PC to your developer-unlocked Microsoft HoloLens, 
you will need to use a PIN to pair your PC with the Microsoft HoloLens.
- When you select **Build** \> **Deploy Solution**, a dialog box will appear for Visual Studio to 
  accept the PIN.
- On your Microsoft HoloLens, go to **Settings** \> **Update** \> **For developers**, and click on **Pair**.
- Type the PIN displayed by your Microsoft HoloLens into the Visual Studio dialog box and click **OK**.
- On your Microsoft HoloLens, select **Done** to accept the pairing.
- The solution will then start to deploy.

### Deploying and running the sample

- To debug the sample and then run it, follow the steps listed above to connect your developer-
  unlocked Microsoft HoloLens, then press F5 or select **Debug** \> **Start Debugging**. To run the
  sample without debugging, press Ctrl+F5 or select **Debug** \> **Start Without Debugging**.
